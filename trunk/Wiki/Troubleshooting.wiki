#summary General information for troubleshooting installation issues

=Troubleshooting Installation Issues=

 * Verify that the .NET Framework v2.0 is installed and working properly.

 * Ensure that you've registered the DLL with REGASM.EXE with the /tlb and /codebase command line switches (see the included register.bat file).  You may want to unregister the DLL and re-register them to confirm.

 * Make sure the DLL and TLB files have the correct file permissions.  Give read/write/execute access to NETWORK, NETWORK_SERVICE and the IUSER_[machineName] accounts.

If you are using an unsigned DLL, you will receive the following error message when registering the DLL with REGASM.EXE:

 _RegAsm : warning RA0000 : Registering an unsigned assembly with /codebase can cause your assembly to  interfere with other applications that may be installed on the same computer. The /codebase switch is intended to be used only with signed assemblies. Please give your assembly a strong name and re-register it._

The object should still work, but I'd recommend unregistering it, compiling and signing the DLL yourself before registering it again so that you don't receive the warning message. Visual Studio 2005 and up can do this automatically from the Project Properties panel on the "Signing" tab. Just pick "< New >" and follow the prompts.
